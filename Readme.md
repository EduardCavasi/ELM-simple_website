# 📰 Hacker News Client (Elm Project)

## 📖 Project Description

This project implements a **basic Hacker News client** built in **Elm**, designed to fetch and display top stories from the Hacker News API. The app presents posts in a table format and allows the user to **filter** and **sort** them by different criteria such as score, title, and date.

The main goal is to gain **hands-on experience** with real-world Elm development, including:

- Fetching and decoding data from a remote API  
- Managing application state using the Elm Architecture  
- Displaying structured data in a dynamic HTML view  
- Writing and running an automated test suite
